Archives are weird places. They often have [abstruse]{} rules and I
often have no idea what to expect—especially when going to foreign
archives and collections. The obscurity of the whole archival research
process can seem really daunting. Especially for economists. I remember
a friend of mine asking me after an economic history PhD class, “so how
exactly do we use an archive?” I had no idea.

Having a site like [**Fresh from the
Archives**](http://dissertationreviews.org/fresh-from-the-archives) is
pretty great. It’s a collection of reviews of various archives around
the world and takes the mystery out of the archival process. Having a
couple tips can really save you precious time when doing primary source
research. Especially for those of us who have no idea what we’re doing.
