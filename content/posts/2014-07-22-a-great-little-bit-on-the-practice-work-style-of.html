<p>A great little bit on the practice/work style of my friend, Erin Riley, a textile artist. (h<a href="//www.emptykingdom.com/featured/one-piece-of-art-erin-riley/">ttp://www.emptykingdom.com/featured/one-piece-of-art-erin-riley/</a>)</p>

<p><strong><span>How do you start your day? Is there something you do every morning?</span></strong></p>
<p>I usually just make sure I have a decent amount of coffee and water within reach and make sure I have all the colors I need to work for a while. I turn on all the lights, fans, take my vitamins, check my email and then get to weaving.</p>
