Norwegian population settlement in the United States (and Canada) at the
turn of the century.

![Norwegian Population Settlement in the
U.S.](http://pages.stolaf.edu/locluth/files/2014/07/Norlie-settlement-map-e1406570641845.png)

From the **["Locating Lutherans"
project](http://pages.stolaf.edu/locluth/project/usa-scale/)**.
Originally from (I believe), **[Olaf Morgan
Norlie's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_M._Norlie)** "History of
the Norwegian People in America Paperback" (1925).

On the subject of historic Scandinavian migration and its effect *in
Scandinavia*, I highly recommend a recent job market paper by my
colleagues **Mounir Karadja** and **Erik Prawitz**, **["Exit, Voice and
Political Change: Evidence from Swedish Mass Migration to the United
States"](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qmxomggukmflct6/KaradjaPrawitz2015-ExitVoicePoliticalChange.pdf?dl=0?raw=1 "Exit, Voice and Political Change: Evidence from Swedish Mass Migration to the United States")**.
