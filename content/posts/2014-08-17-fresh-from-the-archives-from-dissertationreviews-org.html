<p>Archives are weird places. They often have <span>abstruse</span> rules and I often have no idea what to expect&#8212;especially when going to foreign archives and collections. The obscurity of the whole archival research process can seem really daunting. Especially for economists. I remember a friend of mine asking me after an economic history PhD class, &#8220;so how exactly do we use an archive?&#8221; I had no idea.</p>
<p>Having a site like <a href="http://dissertationreviews.org/fresh-from-the-archives"><strong>Fresh from the Archives</strong></a> is pretty great. It&#8217;s a collection of reviews of various archives around the world and takes the mystery out of the archival process. Having a couple tips can really save you precious time when doing primary source research. Especially for those of us who have no idea what we&#8217;re doing.</p>
