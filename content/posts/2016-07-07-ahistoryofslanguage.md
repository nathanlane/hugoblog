title: Forty Years of the S (& R) Programming Language
type: post
---

O.g. data scientist and S developer, Richard Becker, gave a <strong>shamelessly wonky</strong> keynote address on the <strong><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/useR-international-R-User-conference/useR2016/Forty-years-of-S">"Forty Years of S"</a></strong> (and thus, the deep history of the R language). Great insights into the wild innovative collaborations (and mythologies) that grew out of Bell Labs, and dense with data science history -- including the birth of R's "<-" arrow operator. Gold.
