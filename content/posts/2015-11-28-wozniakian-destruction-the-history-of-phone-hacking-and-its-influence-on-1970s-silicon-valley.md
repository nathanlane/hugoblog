FiveThiryEight Signal's Series had a great small documentary piece on
the history of phone hacking in 1960s-1980s, through the lens of Steve
Wozniak and Steve Job's pre-Apple bedroom-based manufacturing of "blue
bloxes," devices used for manipulating the nation's telecommunication
infrastructure. The tidy punchline: "if we hadn't made those little blue
boxes, there might never have been an Apple computer." Importantly,
piece pays homage to **[the classic Esquire piece on the rise of analog
phone hacking](http://classic.esquire.com/secrets-of-the-blue-box/#)** ,
the predecessor to PC-based hacking culture.\
