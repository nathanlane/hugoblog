from Stockholm. type: post ---

There's a lot useful R programming that comes out of the Stockholm
University economics community, like Mahmood Arai's **[code for
estimating clustered standard
errors](http://www.ne.su.se/polopoly_fs/1.216115.1426234213!/menu/standard/file/clustering1.pdf "Cluster-robust standard errors using R")**--small
programs that go a long way in making R more comfortable for
Stata-minded econometrics folks.

Whelp, my pal **[Sirus
Dehdari](https://sites.google.com/site/sirusddari/r)**, a metrics guy
and fellow Ph.D. candidate in economics, has some fresh code for
producing both regression tables (with spatially correlated errors and
other useful stuff) and regression discontinuity plots--in the vein of
Outreg and Binscatter in Stata, respectively. [**Check
out**](https://sites.google.com/site/sirusddari/r) `rddplot.R`
and `rdd.R`.

Whew--the first post after 4 months of trauma after my computer crash.
