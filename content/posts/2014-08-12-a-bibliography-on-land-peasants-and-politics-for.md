<div class="link_description">

I have been doing a ton of archival work the past three weeks in DC at
the National Archives II so I haven’t had too many updates!

In line with this hunt’s theme is this fantastic old Southeast Asian
agrarian political economy bibliography. [Written by ]{}[James C Scott
and Howard Leichter in ]{}[1972 for the [Land Tenure Center at
UWisconsin—Madison](http://www.nelson.wisc.edu/ltc/), it comes straight
from ]{}[the USAID archive](https://decsearch.usaid.gov)[, ]{}

[]{}[While economists taking a PhD developmental sequence all know the
“core” papers on land reform (such as the early contract theoretic or
]{}[]{}[empirical work on West
Bengal](http://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/mghatak/barga.pdf)[), it’s a shame
that there is an incredible literature on agrarian political economy
from the 1960s and 1970s that is increasingly lost to most development
students! Therein are some great ideas. ]{}
