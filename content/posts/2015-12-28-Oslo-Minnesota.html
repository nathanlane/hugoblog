<p>Norwegian population settlement in the United States (and Canada) at the turn of the century. </p>
<p><img src='http://pages.stolaf.edu/locluth/files/2014/07/Norlie-settlement-map-e1406570641845.png' alt='Norwegian Population Settlement in the U.S.' /></p>
<p>From the <strong><a href='http://pages.stolaf.edu/locluth/project/usa-scale/'   >&quot;Locating Lutherans&quot; project</a></strong>. Originally from (I believe), <strong><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_M._Norlie'   >Olaf Morgan Norlie&#39;s</a></strong> &quot;History of the Norwegian People in America Paperback&quot; (1925). </p>
<p>On the subject of historic Scandinavian migration and its effect <em>in Scandinavia</em>, I highly recommend a recent job market paper by my colleagues <strong>Mounir Karadja</strong> and <strong>Erik Prawitz</strong>, <strong><a href='https://www.dropbox.com/s/qmxomggukmflct6/KaradjaPrawitz2015-ExitVoicePoliticalChange.pdf?dl=0?raw=1' title='Exit, Voice and Political Change: Evidence from Swedish Mass Migration to the United States'  >&quot;Exit, Voice and Political Change: Evidence from Swedish Mass Migration to the United States&quot;</a></strong>.</p>
