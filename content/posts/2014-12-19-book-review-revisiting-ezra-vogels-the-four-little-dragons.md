Sometimes the jacket covers of books are so dated that the obscure
contents that still hold up in 2014. The Four Little Dragons was
published in 1991, but the narrative still matters. **[Ezra Vogel's The
Four Little
Dragons](http://www.amazon.com/The-Four-Little-Dragons-Industrialization/dp/067431526X/ref=pd_sim_b_4?ie=UTF8&refRID "The Four Little Dragons")**
is a comparative primer (lecture) that distills key narratives and
lessons from four "Asian miracle" economies. Vogel skillfully narrates
the rapid growth episodes of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and
Taiwan in a slim volume. Remarkably, he synthesizes the varied
experiences of these late developers, drawing key insights from a rich
comparative setting. This guide is a solid starting place for those
wanting to understand "what happened."

While concise, and written in an almost aphoristic style, there is no
shortage of ideas and bibliographic material. Western scholars can view
the Asian growth miracle as one big blob of statist industrial
strategies. But paces, policies, and timelines very, and Vogel's brevity
amplifies differences among the four dragons. For instance, his
juxtaposition of Singapore and Hong Kong will frustrate grand theorizers
of the post-war Asian experience and those looking for crisp models of
structural change.

Vogel wrangles insights from these experiences, but you wont find a
simple, grand explanation here. His final theoretic chapter is written
in a chunky, pragmatic style, much like the preceding case studies, and
highlights a number of key takeaways. Common patterns have bite: The
post war era found societal hierarchies reshuffled and old elites were
often supplanted. Each regime presided over industrialization with a
sense of urgency; trauma undergirded the rise of the region's KMTs or
PAPs and binding political threats loomed. Importantly, new political
elites had a template for industrialization: Japan's Meiji-era. Finally,
as a sociologist, as well, Vogel forcefully highlights the importance of
the Confucian past in allowing the four dragons to produce competitive
bureaucracies.

In sum, Four Little Dragons is a great introduction to "what happened"
across post-war Asia. Instead of a giant comparative tome or slick
theories, Vogel deliveries the key issues any scholar of
industrialization has to confront. For this reason, [The Four Little
Dragons]{style="text-decoration: underline;"} is a great reading for
popular economic readers or for a college/graduate course syllabus.
