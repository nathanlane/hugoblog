<div class="link_description">
<p><a href="http://www.naksung.re.kr/xe/egk" title="Historic Economic Data Korea" target="_blank">Here is a cool batch of datasets (mainly aggregates!) from Korea&#8217;s Nakseongdae Institute of Economic Research</a>, one of which is a nice collection of material covering the colonial Japanese period of Korea (1910-1945). [Just run that sucker through Google translate.]</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re doing data work in economic history, your life is messy. Even more, if you&#8217;re doing historical work for a developing country, <em><strong>finding</strong> </em>the data is often a massive part of the job. Data is hidden. Maybe on microfilm, if you&#8217;re lucky. Perhaps lost, missing or buried in an archive. Heck, the data may have even been destroyed by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge_rule_of_Cambodia">utopian Communist regime</a>. But really, the biggest problem is data legibility: we simply don&#8217;t know where foreign, historic data <em><strong>is</strong></em>.</p>
<p>As opposed to doing Western economic history, there isn&#8217;t a &#8220;users group&#8221; for core historic data (unless we&#8217;re talking about the Murdoch map). For instance, if you sit in an economic history seminar/workshop in Cambridge, you quickly realize how much general advice there is regarding old US census material. However, for the developing world, in particular Africa (again, unless we&#8217;re talking about the Murdoch map GIS file), East, Near East, Southeast Asia, you&#8217;re a bit screwed. The least of which is because of a language barrier and an economic history community far, far away from you&#8212;if it exists at all.</p>
<p>That said, I&#8217;m going to post historic electronic data resources I find for the developing world. I am working on a long term project on Asian structural change with wonderful folks at Harvard, Tufts, and NYU, so we come across some cool stuff from time to time.</p>
<p>If you find anything cool, or have a dataset to share, email me: <a href="nlane@fas.harvard.edu"><div class="media image"><img alt="image" border="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/614ae228bf51e8ec03352e1c00861621.png" title="Email image created with safemail.justlikeed.net" /></div></a></p>
