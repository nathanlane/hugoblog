<p>I have been doing a ton of archival work the past three weeks in DC at the National Archives II so I haven&#8217;t had too many updates!</p>
<p>In line with this hunt&#8217;s theme is this fantastic old Southeast Asian agrarian political economy bibliography. <span>Written by </span><span>James C Scott and Howard Leichter in </span><span>1972 for the <a href="http://www.nelson.wisc.edu/ltc/" target="_blank">Land Tenure Center at UWisconsin&#8212;Madison</a>, it comes straight from </span><a href="https://decsearch.usaid.gov" target="_blank">the USAID archive</a><span>, </span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span></span><span>While economists taking a PhD developmental sequence all know the &#8220;core&#8221; papers on land reform (such as the early contract theoretic or </span><span></span><a href="http://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/mghatak/barga.pdf" target="_blank">empirical work on West Bengal</a><span>), it&#8217;s a shame that there is an incredible literature on agrarian political economy from the 1960s and 1970s that is increasingly lost to most development students! Therein are some great ideas. </span></p>
