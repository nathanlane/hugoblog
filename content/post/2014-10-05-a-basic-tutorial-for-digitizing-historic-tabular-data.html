title: 'Tutorial: A Beginner''s Guide to Scraping Historic Table Data'
type: post
---

<p>
This is a simple introduction to scraping tables from historic (scanned) documents. It is by no means definitive. Instead, this is a broad overview aimed at researchers with minimal programming experience tackling smaller digitization projects--say, nothing more than 200 pages.  I focus on OCRing material with ABBYY FineReader, a popular <em>commercial</em> program for OCRing. ABBYY has a relatively gentle learning curve and, importantly, straightforward table functionality.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>
For those more comfortable with the command line and programming, or for open source advocates, I suggest free programmatic alternatives for each tutorial step. Larger complex digitization projects often entail more technical elbow grease and advanced use of such tools.

<h3>First, Some OCRing Tips.</h3>
<ul style="padding-left: 60px;">
	<li style="text-align: left;">Try to work with scans that are at least 300 DPI, saved in TIFF format. PDFs are often unavoidable, but use less "lossy" formats when possible.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="padding-left: 60px;">
	<li style="text-align: left;">The older the text, the harder OCRing will be. This is especially true for text from the early 1900s and prior.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="padding-left: 60px;">
	<li style="text-align: left;">Cleaning images improves text recognition. Pre-process scans to remove stains and borders; fix page orientation; deskew; and normalize page illumination.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="padding-left: 60px;">
	<li style="text-align: left;">The straighter your page, the more likely programs are to recognize tabular content.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="padding-left: 60px;">
	<li style="text-align: left;">Experiment with different color settings for your project. People debate the efficacy of binarized (black-white) versus color formats. Explore what works best for your project, the benefits are high.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="padding-left: 60px;">
	<li style="text-align: left;">OCR quality suffers at very low and very high resolutions. If you scan at a higher resolution, drop the resolution before OCRing.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="padding-left: 60px;">
	<li style="text-align: left;">OCR software is poor at reading small text.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="padding-left: 60px;">
	<li style="text-align: left;">OCR software needs your help, especially for weird type faces: invest in training software prior to OCRing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Convert Scans: split PDFs &amp; convert to TIFF.</h3>
<p>
Most digitization projects don't start with clean TIFF files. They start with a nasty, multi-page PDFs produced from clumsy library scanning sessions. Before OCRing our scans, we must pre-process (batch clean) our images. But even before we can clean our documents, we must we must break apart our multi-page PDF and convert it to TIFF format. This is the format used by our pre-processing software, as well as by other OCRing tools:
</p>
<h4>Using Adobe Acrobat Pro.</h4>
<p>
If you have the luxury of Adobe Acrobat Pro, you can easily convert multi-page scans or a set of combined PDF images into TIFFS. (File: <strong>Save As &gt; Image &gt; TIFFs</strong>). Better yet, you can use their GUI to extract and export subsets of the PDF document to TIFF format.
</p>

<h4>Open source alternatives:</h4>
<p>
If you don't have access to Acrobat Pro, you're in luck. There are oodles of open source tools for breaking apart PDFs and/or batch conversion. <strong><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/)" target="_blank">ImageMagick</a></strong> is the workhorse open source tool for command line-based image manipulation and is incorporated into many digitization projects. It is cross-platform and can be integrated into most major programming languages. For OSX, <strong><a href="https://github.com/thejefflarson/pdf-splitter" target="_blank">Pdf-Splitter</a></strong> by Pro-Publica's Jeff Larson is a simple command line tool that utilizes native OSX libraries. Born from the frustration of dealing with PDFs, there are many Python packages for deconstructing documents. For instance, the <strong><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pdfserenitynow/0.6.7" target="_blank">pdfserenity</a></strong> package converts multi-page PDFs into TIFFs.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/PyPDF2/" target="_blank"><strong>pyPDF2</strong></a> package in Python is especially useful at manipulating PDFs, which I cover in <strong><a href="http://www.nathanlane.info/?p=369" target="_blank">this post here</a></strong>. Also, it's pretty darn fast!
</p>
<h3>2. Pre-process TIFFS with ScanTailor.</h3>
<p>
Pre-processing images--straightening documents, splitting pages, removing distortions, de-staining pages, etc.--can make or break character recognition. In the preceding step we converted our files so that we could pre-process our images using <a href="http://scantailor.org/" target="_blank"><strong>ScanTailor</strong>,</a> an awesome open source tool <em>specifically</em> for batch cleaning scanned documents. It only accepts TIFF and does a limited number of basic automated tasks, but it does them well. Hence, it has become a staple of the <a href="http://www.diybookscanner.org/" target="_blank">digitization and hacker/text scraping community</a>.
</p>
<p>
While many OCRing suites, like ABBYY FineReader, also have solid pre-processing tools, ScanTailor has key advantages. I have found it is much better at straightening pages than most tools. Again, straight pages are crucial for recognizing table structure. ScanTailor also comes with a command line version that be used to script larger tasks.

<h4>Other open source and programmatic tools for pre-processing.</h4>
<p>
While most people use ImageMagick for basic image conversion tasks, many people utilize its powerful features for <strong><a href="http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/textcleaner/index.php" target="_blank">batch document cleaning scripts</a></strong>. <strong><a href="www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">GIMP</a></strong>, the popular open source graphic suite, also has promising batch pre-processing capabilities: people have had success with <strong><a href="http://gimper.net/resources/nuvola-tools.582/" target="_blank">Nuvola tools for cleaning up greyscale scans</a></strong>.
</p>
<h3>3. OCRing with ABBYY FineReader 12.</h3>
<p>
Now that we have a pile of cleaned TIFFs, we load the files into ABBYY FineReader for further  1) pre-processing, 2) training, 3) table analysis/OCRing, and 4) error verification:
</p>

<h4>First, use ABBYY's pre-processing tools to further clean and select the optimal OCR resolution.</h4>
<p>
Once loaded into FineReader, you will likely want to further clean the scans using the built-in pre-processing tools (<strong>"Edit Image"</strong>). One tool that is particular useful is the FineReader's optimal resolution tool, which scales the resolution of the image to maximize recognition.
</p>

<h4>But before you OCR, train.</h4>
<p>
Training is the next crucial step. With historic data, you will likely get poor results if you neglect to train the OCR software and jump straight into OCRing. The ability to fully train OCR engines distinguishes professional software from less sophisticated OCRing tools.
</p>
<p>
In general, training improves the ability of OCR algorithms to correctly classify characters by "tuning" the algorithm on a sample of your document. In FineReader, training is a trivial task, where you walk the program through recognizing a sample set of characters from your document. You can easily append and save these training files, called "<strong>User Patterns</strong>."
</p>

<h4>"Analyzing" &amp; "Reading" - Table recognition &amp; OCRing in FineReader.</h4>
<p>
In FineReader, layout recognition and OCR are known as "analyzing" and "reading", respectively. Unlike straight forward digitization of textual material, we want to make sure FineReader recognizes our table layouts and correct mishaps before it reads the content of individual table cells: First, the<strong> Analyze Selected Pages</strong> command detects the content of our pages (i.e. finds our tables). We then confirm that FineReader has recognized tables and table cells correctly, adjusting mistakes "by hand" with the built-in table editing tools. Second, we OCR the table contents with the <strong>Read Selected Pages</strong> command.
</p>

<h4>Check for mistakes, tweak, &amp; repeat.</h4>
<p>
OCRing is never perfect. Once FineReader has "read" your document, you will want to check for errors. For each page, FineReader gives a rough error rate, reporting the number of characters it is uncertain about on each document page.  The "Verify Text" tool allows us to easily check and correct each uncertain character.
</p>
<p>
After the first OCR session it is best to get a sense of how successful character recognition was and the types of errors that occur. Often, exploring pre-processing and improved training can improve text recognition.</p>
<h3>5. Post-processing.</h3>
<p>Ultimately, FineReader will spit out .csv or .xlsx files, but newly digitized content still needs to be tidied up. </p>

<p>Especially if you’re working with old documents, OCRing produces some junk output. Dust, scratches, and page discoloration can get picked up as weird symbols: *, ^, \, etc.. You can easily correct these blemishes </span><a style="color: #7a7a7a;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: bold;">using regular expressions</span></a><span style="color: #666666;"> in your preferred scripting language (using </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #666666;">sub/gsub</span><span style="color: #666666;"> commands in R,</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #666666;"> re.sub</span><span style="color: #666666;"> type commands in Python). Better yet,</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #666666;"> <a style="color: #7a7a7a;" href="http://http//openrefine.org/" target="_blank">OpenRefine</a> </span><span style="color: #666666;">provides some extremely flexible tools for wrangling OCRd output, making most cleaning tasks trivial while also supporting advanced regular expression use.</p>

<h3>Ending Note. A bit more on OCR software and getting advanced.</h3>
<p>
Why ABBYY FineReader? First, the learning curve is lower than other open source options. The closest open source competition comes from <a href="https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/"><strong>Google’s tesseract OCR program</strong></a>, which is powerful and useful for those comfortable with the command line or OCRing from a preferred programming language. For advanced projects, tesseract offers unmatched flexibility and customization. However in my experience, the tesseract is frustrating to train and has poor table recognition ability.
</p>
<p>
Although it is relatively easy, ABBYY FineReader has downsides. For instance, the Mac version isn't as functional as the complete "Professional" PC version. Moreover, multi-core support is limited for both Professional and basic Corporate versions, making large projects slow and unwieldy (in my experience).
</p>
<p>
While FineReader provides tools for table area recognition, other times we have to pursue more programmatic methods of extracting table. Common approaches can be seen in <a href="http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/image-to-text-ocr-and-imagemagick" target="_blank"><strong>Dan Nugyen’s ProPublica guide</strong></a> and <strong><a href="http://rexdouglass.com/extracting-data-from-printed-tables-in-historical-documents/">Dr. Rex Douglass’ (UCSD Polisci) method</a>,</strong> who use computer vision techniques to "cut up" tables, OCRing individual cells before reassembling the table. I recommend taking a peak at both to understand alternative workflows for table scraping.</p>
<p>
Some users have opted to detect tables after OCRing: first, recognizing text in PDF files and then stripping the OCRd content using <a href="tabula.nerdpower.org" target="_blank"><strong>PDF table extraction tools like Tabula</strong></a>. These methods hint to the growing hacker community interested in scraping PDF content. The recent <a href="http://pdfliberation.wordpress.com/"><strong>PDF Liberation Hackathon website</strong></a> features some great tools to this end.
