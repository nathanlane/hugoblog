<h3>The Question</h3>
<p>How do I take over 100 NetCDF files, each containing thousands of layers of hourly raster data, and translate into dataset?</p>

<p>I'll flesh out the problem more,</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>NetCDF files.</strong> We have over 100 NetCDF datasets: <i> 1850weather.nc, 1851weather.nc , 1851weather , ... , 1971weather, ... etc.</i>.</p>
<li><p><strong>Raster layers.</strong> Each NetCDF is a stack of hourly raster layers: 1850weather.nc: <i> layer.hour1 , layer.hour2 , ... , layer.hour2000, ... etc</i>.</p>
<li><p><strong>Shapefiles.</strong> We also have a shapefile countaining country boundaries.</p>
<li><p><strong>Our goal.</strong> Extract a giant panel dataset, containing average hourly weather data for each country.</p>
</ul>

<p>In other words, we need a way to cycle through each NetCDF file and for every layer within a file, retrieve the average raster stats corresponding to each country in our shapefile. This adds up. </p>

<p>This problem is interesting because normal approaches to processing piles of raster data (using nested loops) takes forever. A more "functional" approach to the problem can be amazingly more efficient.</p>

<p>In this post I consider the ways in which we can tackle this problem (Part I.) and then motive a solution (Part 2.) for comfortably extracting statistics from gigs of GIS weather data.</p>

<h3>Part 1. - A comparison of Two Approaches.</h3>

<p>Consider two approaches to our problem, a conventional loop-based approach and an optimized approach.</p>

<p><strong>Conventional Dead Ends with Loops.</strong></p>

<p>
Most of us would attack the problem using nexted loops. The first loop reads and prepares the NetCDF file; a second deals with the raster layers within each file.
</p>

{{< highlight R >}}
for(i in 1:number_of_netcdffiles) {

   # Load file[i]
   # Do preliminary stuff to file[i]

	for(l in 1:number_of_rasterlayers) {

     # Extract geographic statistics from layer[l]
     # Add statistics from layer[l] to a data set

	}

	 # Save giant file for each NetCDF file

}
{{< / highlight >}}

<p>We're tempted to iterate over the raster layers ( <code>layer[l]</code> ) and use standard R GIS libraries to, say, extract everage values from the rasters over a country boundary shapefile (e.g. hourly weather readings over the borders of Finland). Above all, we're tempted to "harvest" the geographic statistics, taking the values we extract and collating them in a giant file.</p>

<p>Straight up, this is a bad idea.</p>

<p>Loops can be abysmal for these tasks. When iterating through objects with a <code>for()</code> loop, we're actually calling many tiny functions ... <i>over and over again</i>. Not only is the <code>for()</code> a function, but so is the ":", and so are the brackets "[ ]".</p>

<p>To make matters worse, when we manipulate a vector or data.frame with a for-loop, we're also making many internal copies of our objects. Unbeknownst to us, mundane data transormations can quickly fill out memory with repeated copies.</p>

<p>Moreover, embedded in our first attempt is the agony loop-based "data-harvesting." Unless we're carefull, using a loop to incrementally "grow" a dataset will bring your computer to its knees.</p>

<p><strong>Consider an Alternative Approach.</strong></p>

<p>Instead of loops, the following template - and specifically the full program in Part 2 - considers a solution more suited to R.</p>

<p>By combining functional style with the use of the <code>raster()</code> library, we eliminate the need for nested loops and boil the problem down to a streamlined "apply+function" structure.</p>

{{< highlight R >}}
generate_statistics_from_netcdf <- function( input_netcdffile ) {
	# Turn input_netcdffile into a "raster brick" ...
	# Get statistics from "raster brick" ...
	# Save statistics for input_netcdffile ...
}
lapply( list_of_netcdffiles , generate_statistics_from_netcdffile)
{{< / highlight >}}

<p>Instead of using a for-loop to iterate over NetCDF weather files, we take a list of files <code>list_of_netcdffiles</code> and "apply" a big function, <code>generate_statistics_from_netcdf</code>.</p>

<p>We eliminate the entire inner loop with the help of <code>RasterBrick</code> manipulations. That is, instead of looping over the individual raster layers within a NetCDF file, we transform the NetCDF into a <code>RasterBrick</code> object and manipulate the collection of layers as a single object.</p>

Appealing to <code>RasterBrick</code> instead of cycling through individual layers feels a lot of like the practice of <emph>"vectorization"</emph>, where instead of iteraring over individual members of a vector one-by-one, we work directly with the vector. Stylistically, this is a common line of attack for writing more efficient code.</p>

<h3>Part 2. The Program.</h3>

<p>Let's expand the alternative template above into a full program.</p>

<p>The first part of the program defines our functions: the main <code> generate_datatable_from_rasterbricks</code> function and a set of small sub-functions used within it.</p>

<p>The <code>generate_datatable_from_rasterbricks</code> functon eats a raw NetCDF file, and using a a team of smaller functions, reads it as a RasterBrick, aligns it with our country shapefile, extracts the country-level weather statistcs, then saves the output file.</p>

<p>The second part contains the core code. Here we define a list of NetCDF raster files (<code>raster_file_list</code>) and the country shapefile (<code>countryshape</code>) used in our calculations. An *apply function feeds NetCDF files through the <code>generate_datatable_from_rasterbricks</code> function. </p>

<p>Instead of using <code>lapply</code> I use <code>mclapply</code>: the latter is a multiprocessor version of list-apply provided by the <code>parallel()</code> package. Conveniently, <code>mclapply</code> utilizes the power of out multi-core processor (if we have one).</p>

<p>The third part of the program takes our saved files and assembles them into a giant file via the amazingly useful functions provifed by the <code>data.table()</code>package. With <code>lapply()</code>, our list of .csv files is opened with the speedy <code>fread()</code> function. A list big list of opened .csv files is then fed through <code>rbindlist()</code>, which combines them into a single massive data.table.</p>

<h4>One thing to try.</h4>

<p><b>Compiling functions with R's byte-compiler</b></p>

<p>Writing our own functions also allows us to easily use R's <code>compiler()</code> on chunks of our code. The <code>cmpfun()</code> function allows us to generate byte-compiled versions of our own functions, </p>

{{< highlight R >}}
c.myfunction <- compiler::cmpfun(myfunction)
{{< / highlight >}}

<p>Sometimes byte-compiled function can give our programs another performance boost, often with minimal upfront costs, and can yield surprising gains in big data projects without having to turn to Rcpp/C++.</p>
