Last year <strong><a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/a16010/30-year-old-computer-runs-school-heat/">Popular Mechanics and WOODtv reported</a></strong> that a single Amiga has been running non-stop for three decades, controlling the heating and cooling system of nineteen Michigan public schools. 

In the spirit of vintage computing, the prolofic researchers at Muckrock.com have a really great ongoing project: <strong><a href="https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2016/mar/23/hunt-governments-oldest-computer-continues/">the hunt for the government's oldest computer</a></strong>.

Allan Lasser of MuckRock, in his <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2016/feb/24/hunt-governments-oldest-computer/">original blog post for the project</a>:

<blockquote>
As the saying goes, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” If a machine is doing its job, reliably and without error, then common sense dictates that you just shouldn’t mess with it. This is doubly true for computers and quadruply true for government computers. This lends itself to an obvious question: what’s the government computer most in need of an upgrade?
