  The following is a simple program for building data sets using the United Nation&rsquo;s COMTRADE API.
Note: this code does not apply to the &ldquo;Bulk download&rdquo; API, which allows users to download entire chunks of annual or monthly data. Instead, this program is for making specific, repeated queries for import (export) data between certain countries.

  The problem. R can be nasty when it comes to reading and writing &ldquo;large&rdquo; datasets. As practitioners, we often appeal to hacky practices, emergent libraries, alternatives methods to avoid crashing our systems during heavy jobs.
One alternative I had the appealed to was the ff library , a great library for processing large data. Importantly, ff had an awesome function for quickly saving multi-gig .csv files (write.table.ffdf).
Recently, however, write.

  </h1>
  <span class="post-date">Tue, Jul 26, 2016</span>
  Below is a guide to installing Microsoft Open R for those using Ubuntu Linux and R-Studio. Microsoft R Open (MRO) is a pretty powerful distribution of R (and yes, completely open source). It builds off (currently) R version 3.3.0, adding some darn useful enhancements, due in part to their use of Intel&rsquo;s Math Kernel Library (MKL).
What is R Open + MKL? What does this mean? Basically Microsoft R Open is an optimized version of your standard R, and can help tremendously if you&rsquo;re doing, say, many intense vector or matrix-based operations.

  It&rsquo;s hard to imagine, but in the 1950s and 1960s Afghanistan was in the throws of mid-century developmental modernism. Western and Communist Bloc aid flowed in. Western-style structures rose around Kabul. West German machinery filled new government printing plants and Czechoslovakia invested in a number heavy industrial projects, including a 5 million dollar concrete factory located outside of Kabul.
Negotiated in 1955 by a new Minister of Finance, (General) Abdul Malik, who was inspired by the developmental planning of Turkey, the Czech-built plant opened in 1957 in the district of Jabal Saraj, near Kabul.

  Bloomberg published a long-form piece on the sale of a &ldquo;Texas Ranch That&rsquo;s the Size of a Small Nation&rdquo;. In fact, the Waggoner Ranch property is the largest U.S. ranch within a single fence:

The rapid expansion of the estate, from the late 1880s through the turn of the century, corresponds to the period covered by Dr. Rick Hornbeck&rsquo;s great paper, &ldquo;Barbed Wire: Property Rights and Agricultural Development&rdquo; in the Quarterly Journal of Economics (2010).

In input-output economics, the Leontief inverse (i.e. [I-A]^-1) is ubiquitous. Named after the father of input-output economics, Wassily Leontief, the matrix is a compact representation of the ripple effects in an economy where industries are interconnected. A lone matrix coefficient conveys all direct and indirect effects on output in one sector required by a unit of output from another sector.

A great long read from BuzzFeed New&rsquo;s Chris Geidner with a snippet of Rock Hudson&rsquo;s telegram to longtime friend, Nancy Reagan. A few weeks before his death, the Hollywood star appealed to Reagan for assistence in transferring to a French military hospital for AIDS treatment. Quoting Hudson&rsquo;s publicist at the time, Dale Olson:
“ &lsquo;Only one hospital in the world can offer necessary medical treatment to save life of Rock Hudson or at least alleviate his illness,&rsquo; Olson wrote.

  <span class="post-date">Wed, Jan 27, 2016</span>
  Using a really powerful library to do something simple.  For a current project, I am having to repeatedly manipulate and save a hundred datasets, each with about 4 million observations. While R tools like fread(), part of the data.table library, make it trivial to load massive data sets into memory, writing these data sets&ndash;and doing so repeatedly&ndash;is another story..
When trying to save big data sets, many of folks first recommend the write.

&nbsp; Sublime, like many of these programming-oriented editing notepads, have massively powerful tools that crush Stata's default editor. Moreover, since many people are simultaneously juggling Python, R, and Stata (and more) scripts for a single project, the ability to work from one programming-oriented environment is nice.

  Taking Geospatial Data to R (& how to ditch ArcGIS) For R users it's very straightforward to ditch ArcGIS (for most tasks) in favor of doing everything through an R script. There are many reasons to do this:
 First, if you can do GIS work on your Linux system or Mac without having to run things through a lame emulator. Second, you can cut yourself loose from dealing with the clunky ArcGIS licensing system.

  There's a lot useful R programming that comes out of the Stockholm University economics community, like Mahmood Arai's code for estimating clustered standard errors--small programs that go a long way in making R more comfortable for Stata-minded econometrics folks. Whelp, my pal Sirus Dehdari, a metrics guy and fellow Ph.D. candidate in economics, has some fresh code for producing both regression tables (with spatially correlated errors and other useful stuff) and regression discontinuity plots--in the vein of Outreg and Binscatter in Stata, respectively.

Sometimes the jacket covers of books are so dated that the obscure contents that still hold up in 2014. The Four Little Dragons was published in 1991, but the narrative still matters. Ezra Vogel's The Four Little Dragons is a comparative primer (lecture) that distills key narratives and lessons from four "Asian miracle" economies. Vogel skillfully narrates the rapid growth episodes of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan in a slim volume.

  In a previous tutorial I covered the basics of digitizing old stats with ABBYY FineReader (&amp; alternative digitization tools). Now, I dig into some important digitization nitty gritty: training optical character recognition software to properly read historical content.
&nbsp;
Most historical digitization projects will entail training. Old statistical documents often use long-gone proprietary typefaces. While modern OCR software can easily read Arials and Times New Romans, it needs help with more exotic typography; this is where training come in.

  <span class="post-date">Sun, Oct 19, 2014</span>
  When digitizing old data, we often start with a pile of scanned documents we must reorganize. Much time is spent manually trudging through scans, deducing what variables exist, and selecting the tables we eventually wish to turn into machine-readable data. When you have hundreds of multi-page PDFS, this can be a painful experience. However, automating PDF manipulation with Python can save major time.
The Problem We start with scans of old, provincial statistical yearbooks for a Southeast Asian country.

  <span class="post-date">Sun, Oct 5, 2014</span>
  This is a simple introduction to scraping tables from historic (scanned) documents. It is by no means definitive. Instead, this is a broad overview aimed at researchers with minimal programming experience tackling smaller digitization projects--say, nothing more than 200 pages. I focus on OCRing material with ABBYY FineReader, a popular commercial program for OCRing. ABBYY has a relatively gentle learning curve and, importantly, straightforward table functionality. &nbsp;  For those more comfortable with the command line and programming, or for open source advocates, I suggest free programmatic alternatives for each tutorial step.

  Link: Cleaning OCR’d text with Regular Expressions Often the pain of optical character recognition isn't the OCRing procedure itself, it is cleaning the tiny, little inconsistencies that plague OCRd content. This is especially true when we OCR historical material: even high quality scans can have a speckle or two that get recognized as gibberish.
Adept use of Regular Expressions (regex) coupled with simple Python (or Ruby scripts--or heck, even Notepad++) can be a powerful means of removing nasty errors from OCRd text/CSV files.
