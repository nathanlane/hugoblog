      <description>Data Janitors and Data Carpentry: value in the nitty gritty?  &#34;Report on the investigation of engineer and janitor service, Board of education, city of Chicago&#34; (1913)  The fantastic machine learning-oriented podcast, Talking Machines, had an interview with computer scientist, David Mimno (also: his course syllabus on text mining for historians is awesome.). They spent some time discussing a recent essay by Mimno, that riffed off the New York Times &#34;</description>

      <description>Social scientists often use experts to &#34;code&#34; datasets; experts read some stuff and code that stuff using a coding rule (a right-left political spectrum, etc.). But this a slow, painful process for constructing a dataset
Below is an awesome, succinct Kickstarter seminar on how to categorize (political) text using crowd-sourcing from quant-y political scientist, Drew Conway (http://drewconway.com/):

The great lil&#39; seminar is related to his recent working paper, &#34;Methods for Collecting Large-scale Non-expert Text Coding&#34;</description>

      <description>Link: An Investigative Journalist&#39;s Guide to Geolocating Media 
bell?ngcat, a crowd-funded start-up of Middle East wonks, investigative journalists, and researchers, has made some waves for demonstrating how to geo-locate an Iraqi ISIS training camp.
Here are a couple of fantastic guides to some of the techniques they use to geolocate media, combining picture/video data alongside common geographic tools. One of the interesting techniques used lately consists of extracting and mapping metadata from photographs using tools like Panoramio.</description>

      <description>The Bastards Book of Regular Expressions by Dan Nguyen  I love regexes even more because they make it possible – if not trivial – to do research and analysis that is otherwise impossible, because believe it or not, most research and analysis start out with just giant blobs of text   The Bastard&amp;#8217;s Book of Regex is a great (free!) text on cleaning up crappy data with regular expressions.</description>
