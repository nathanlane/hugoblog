      <description>I am used to writing code in notepad programs, such as N++ and the fantastic Sublime Text 3. Here&#39;s a quick note on connecting a powerful coding notepad in Linux to Stata.
&amp;nbsp; Sublime, like many of these programming-oriented editing notepads, have massively powerful tools that crush Stata&#39;s default editor. Moreover, since many people are simultaneously juggling Python, R, and Stata (and more) scripts for a single project, the ability to work from one programming-oriented environment is nice.</description>

      <description>Link: An Investigative Journalist&#39;s Guide to Geolocating Media 
bell?ngcat, a crowd-funded start-up of Middle East wonks, investigative journalists, and researchers, has made some waves for demonstrating how to geo-locate an Iraqi ISIS training camp.
Here are a couple of fantastic guides to some of the techniques they use to geolocate media, combining picture/video data alongside common geographic tools. One of the interesting techniques used lately consists of extracting and mapping metadata from photographs using tools like Panoramio.</description>

      <description>The Bastards Book of Regular Expressions by Dan Nguyen  I love regexes even more because they make it possible – if not trivial – to do research and analysis that is otherwise impossible, because believe it or not, most research and analysis start out with just giant blobs of text   The Bastard&amp;#8217;s Book of Regex is a great (free!) text on cleaning up crappy data with regular expressions.</description>
