FiveThiryEight Signal&#39;s Series had a great small documentary piece on the history of phone hacking in 1960s-1980s, through the lens of Steve Wozniak and Steve Job&#39;s pre-Apple bedroom-based manufacturing of &#34;blue bloxes,&#34; devices used for manipulating the nation&#39;s telecommunication infrastructure.

      <description>Singapore, 1967. Location: &#34;North Bridge road just after Capitol theatre.&#34; Copyright David Ayer.
&amp;nbsp;
Sometimes the jacket covers of books are so dated that the obscure contents that still hold up in 2014. The Four Little Dragons was published in 1991, but the narrative still matters. Ezra Vogel&#39;s The Four Little Dragons is a comparative primer (lecture) that distills key narratives and lessons from four &#34;Asian miracle&#34; economies. Vogel skillfully narrates the rapid growth episodes of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan in a slim volume.</description>

      <description>Link: Watch a stampede of idiots endlessly run straight into a spinning metal thing. &#34;Artist Dave Fothergill—who’s done visual effects for a bunch of National Geographic documentary films—has created a simple 3D animation of a crowd stampeding straight into a rotating metal thing.

      <description>&#34;In Allende’s Chile, a futuristic op room was to bring socialism into the computer age.&#34;
Link: From the New Yorker - `The Planning Machine&#39; By Evgeny Morozov ``The consultant, Stafford Beer, had been brought in by Chile’s top planners to help guide the country down what Salvador Allende, its democratically elected Marxist leader, was calling `the Chilean road to socialism.&#39; Beer was a leading theorist of cybernetics—a discipline born of midcentury efforts to understand the role of communication in controlling social, biological, and technical systems.</description>

      <description>(A respite from data- - ) In the 1960s and 70s Cambodia was home an emergent rock scene, inspired by Western rock that was rolling its way into the region. The rise of the Khmer Rouge put a swift end to a subversive subculture. As in the clips below, youth culture isn&#39;t quite compatible with authoritarianism...much less a utopian regime attempting a hard reboot of society to &#34;year zero.&#34;</description>
