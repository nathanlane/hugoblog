      <description>&#34;Wozniakian Destruction&#34; - The History of Phone Hacking &amp; its Influence on 1970s Silicon Valley     A bundle of blue boxes from phreaking.wikia.com  &amp;nbsp;
FiveThiryEight Signal&#39;s Series had a great small documentary piece on the history of phone hacking in 1960s-1980s, through the lens of Steve Wozniak and Steve Job&#39;s pre-Apple bedroom-based manufacturing of &#34;blue bloxes,&#34; devices used for manipulating the nation&#39;s telecommunication infrastructure.

Moreover, since many people are simultaneously juggling Python, R, and Stata (and more) scripts for a single project, the ability to work from one programming-oriented environment is nice.</description>
