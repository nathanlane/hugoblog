      <description>&#34;Wozniakian Destruction&#34; - The History of Phone Hacking &amp; its Influence on 1970s Silicon Valley     A bundle of blue boxes from phreaking.wikia.com  &amp;nbsp;
FiveThiryEight Signal&#39;s Series had a great small documentary piece on the history of phone hacking in 1960s-1980s, through the lens of Steve Wozniak and Steve Job&#39;s pre-Apple bedroom-based manufacturing of &#34;blue bloxes,&#34; devices used for manipulating the nation&#39;s telecommunication infrastructure.

Link: From the New Yorker - `The Planning Machine&#39; By Evgeny Morozov ``The consultant, Stafford Beer, had been brought in by Chile’s top planners to help guide the country down what Salvador Allende, its democratically elected Marxist leader, was calling `the Chilean road to socialism.&#39; Beer was a leading theorist of cybernetics—a discipline born of midcentury efforts to understand the role of communication in controlling social, biological, and technical systems.</description>
